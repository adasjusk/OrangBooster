### Method 1 - PowerShell (Slower, Safer)

-   Right-click on the Windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal (Not CMD).
-   Copy and paste the code below and press enter  
```
irm oranges.lt/get.ps1 | iex
``` 

### Method 2 - Download File (Quicker Way, But Also Safe)
-   Download the file under the code button from [GitHub](https://github.com/adasjusk/Orange-Booster)
-   Run the file named `orangbostr.exe`

---

### Not Method - but a old cli (Old, Unsafe, Deprecated)
If someone wants to update this version then make a issue or pull.
if you still want that old legacy batch here:
```
irm raw.githubusercontent.com/adasjusk/OrangBooster/legacy/get.ps1 | iex
```
